## Overview
Portland Community College (PCC) offers motorcycle courses through a collaboration with Team Oregon, a well-respected authority in motorcycle rider safety and skills training. The courses are tailored to enhance rider competency, focusing on safe, smart, and skillful riding. With an established presence within the community, these courses target entry-level riders, requiring them to complete a recognized safety training as mandated by state law to gain the necessary motorcycle endorsement on their licenses. This collaboration positions PCC as a vital contributor to rider education and safety in Oregon, upholding state legislative requirements and promoting responsible motorcycle riding.

The association with Team Oregon reinforces PCC's role as an educational provider committed to the safety and welfare of motorcycle enthusiasts. Compared to other educational offerings in the state, Team Oregon's training is distinguished by its comprehensive approach that combines theoretical knowledge with practical skills.

## Products & Services 
PCC, in partnership with Team Oregon, offers the Basic Motorcycle Rider Training (BRT), specifically designed for novice riders. The BRT is a comprehensive 15-hour course that combines six hours of classroom instruction with nine hours of on-cycle riding experience. Participants start with fundamental skills such as turning, shifting, and braking, before advancing to more complex techniques like street riding skills and emergency maneuvers. This training is mandatory for individuals under 21 to earn their motorcycle endorsement.

The courses do not just focus on skill acquisition but also instill essential safety habits. Motorcycles and helmets are provided to ensure participants have everything needed to practice safely. Each participant must attend every session and pass a knowledge and skills test to successfully complete the course. This rigorous training ensures riders are fully equipped with the skills necessary to ride safely and responsibly.
