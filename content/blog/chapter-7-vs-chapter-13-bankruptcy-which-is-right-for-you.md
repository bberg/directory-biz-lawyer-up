# Chapter 7 vs. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy: Which is Right for You?

Navigating bankruptcy can be a challenging endeavor. Choosing between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 is a pivotal decision that will significantly affect your financial future and lifestyle. This article breaks down the differences and benefits of Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcies, drawing insights from services offered by firms like [Wotitzky Law Firm](/dir/wotitzky_law_firm) and [Pearson Butler](/dir/pearson_butler).

**Chapter 7 Bankruptcy** is often referred to as "liquidation bankruptcy." It involves the sale of a debtor's non-exempt assets by a trustee, who then distributes the proceeds to creditors. This process typically allows individuals to eliminate many types of unsecured debts, such as credit cards and medical bills, within three to six months. However, it may require selling valuable assets.

**Chapter 13 Bankruptcy** is known as "reorganization bankruptcy." It allows individuals with a reliable income to create a repayment plan to pay back all or part of their debts over a period of three to five years. This plan allows individuals to keep their property and reorganize existing debts to make them more manageable. Chapter 13 is typically suitable for those with an income high enough to cover a repayment plan yet unsuitable for Chapter 7.

## Key Considerations

Several factors can guide your decision between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy:

1. **Type of Debt**: If your debt is primarily unsecured, Chapter 7 might offer a quicker discharge. Chapter 13 is advisable if you have secured debts you aim to keep, like a home or car, and need to catch up on overdue payments.

2. **Income Level**: Passing the means test is crucial for qualifying for Chapter 7. Chapter 13 requires a steady, reliable income to manage monthly repayments.

3. **Assets**: Consider whether you have substantial non-exempt assets. Chapter 13 might preserve these, whereas Chapter 7 could require selling them.

4. **Impact on Credit**: Both will negatively impact your credit score, but Chapter 7 stays on your report for up to 10 years, while Chapter 13 stays for up to 7 years.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Consider your financial goals and whether you prefer immediate debt relief (Chapter 7) or a structured repayment plan (Chapter 13).
