When drafting business contracts, it's essential to incorporate clauses that address potential risks and outline expectations clearly. Here are ten must-have clauses to consider:

   - This clause can exempt parties from performing their obligations due to unforeseeable events like natural disasters, as advised by [Cenkus Law](/dir/cenkus_law).

3. **Limitations on Liability Clause**
   - Setting a cap on the types of compensation and liability limits protects both parties from excessive financial burdens.

4. **Confidentiality Clause**
   - Also known as a non-disclosure agreement, this clause is vital to protect sensitive information shared during business interactions.

5. **Copyright Clause**
   - Essential for transactions involving intellectual property, this clause protects your creative work from misuse or infringement.

6. **Use Restrictions Clause**
   - Establishing conditions for using confidential information minimizes the risk of unauthorized disclosure or exploitation.

7. **Termination Clause**
   - Clearly defining termination conditions and procedures prevents misunderstandings and ensures an orderly exit from the contract.

8. **Warranties and Disclaimers**
   - This clause caps potential claims for dissatisfaction with goods or services, protecting businesses from unlimited claims.

9. **Dispute Resolution Clause**
   - Including a mechanism for resolving conflicts, whether through negotiation, mediation, or arbitration, can save time and resources.
