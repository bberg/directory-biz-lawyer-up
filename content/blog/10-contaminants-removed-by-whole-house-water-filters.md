# 10 Contaminants Removed by Whole House Water Filters

Whole house water filtration systems are essential for providing safer and healthier water throughout your home. These systems ensure that all water, from every tap, is free from numerous contaminants that can be harmful over time. Here, we explore ten key contaminants that these systems effectively eliminate.

## Key Considerations for Whole House Water Filtration

Before selecting a whole house water filtration system, it is crucial to consider factors like the quality of your water source, the specific contaminants present, and the filtration capacity required to adequately meet the demands of your household. Various systems are designed to target different combinations of impurities, so identifying the specific needs of your home is essential.

## Top Contaminants Removed by Whole House Water Filters

1. **Chlorine**: Commonly used in municipal water systems, excessive chlorine can dry skin and hair and has potential health risks. Most whole house filtration systems, like those from [Aquasana's Rhino® series](/dir/aquasana), are effective in reducing chlorine by over 97%.

2. **Chloramine**: A combination of chlorine and ammonia, chloramine can be tricky to remove but is targeted by advanced filtration systems such as [HomePlus's ecoPlus™ series](/dir/home_water_purifiers__filters).

3. **Lead**: This hazardous metal can be present in older plumbing systems. Systems like the OMNIFILTER BF7a from [Water Filter Store](/dir/water_filter_store) ensure comprehensive lead removal.

4. **Sediment**: Particulate matter such as sand, rust, and dirt can lead to clogged pipes and appliances, but systems from [H2O Distributors](/dir/h2o_distributors) are designed to effectively remove these.

5. **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)**: These harmful chemicals are effectively reduced by systems utilizing advanced carbon filters, like those from [NEWater](/dir/newater).

6. **Iron**: Known for staining and metallic taste, iron is targeted by systems such as those offered by [Kind Water Systems](/dir/kind_water_systems), which include options for UV disinfection.

7. **Sulfur**: Often responsible for the rotten egg smell in water, sulfur is removed effectively by systems like those from [Sippel Well Drilling, Inc.](/dir/sippel_well_drilling_inc).

8. **Pesticides and Herbicides**: Harmful to health, these chemicals are targeted by multi-stage systems such as [Aquasana's Rhino® series](/dir/aquasana).

9. **Bacteria and Viruses**: Systems equipped with UV filters, commonly used in whole house filtration setups, handle microbiological contaminants effectively.
