# ZeroWater vs. Brita: Which Pitcher Filter Reigns Supreme?

When it comes to choosing a water filter pitcher, two brands stand out as leaders in the market: ZeroWater and Brita. These popular options offer different filtering technologies and effectiveness, making it essential to compare their performance, contaminant removal efficiency, and overall value. In this article, weâ€™ll dive into the key differences between ZeroWater and Brita, helping you make an informed decision on which one might be the best fit for your needs.

### Contaminant Removal Efficiency

**ZeroWater:** Known for its advanced filtration system, ZeroWater filters use a five-stage process, promising to remove 99.6% of total dissolved solids (TDS) from the water. This includes challenging impurities such as lead, up to 95% of toxic chemicals like PFOS/PFOA, and reducing other metal and non-metal pollutants significantly. According to [ZeroWater](/dir/zerowater), this high efficiency is often verified by customers who appreciate the noticeable taste improvement.

**Brita:** Brita, on the other hand, uses a dual filtration process with activated carbon and ion-exchange resins effective at reducing chlorine taste and odor, zinc, copper, mercury, and cadmium. However, Brita does not remove TDS to the same extent as ZeroWater. Its primary focus is on improving taste and reducing select contaminants rather than a comprehensive purification approach.

### Overall Performance

**Filtering Speed and Capacity:** While Brita filters water more quickly due to its simpler filtration process, the trade-off is a less thorough purification. The Brita Grand Pitcher has a 10-cup capacity and provides a quicker flow rate, making it suitable for those who value convenience.

**ZeroWater**, on the other hand, filters water at a slightly slower rate due to its extensive filtration process. However, it includes a TDS meter to allow users to verify water purity directly, assuring quality over speed.

### Considerations in Cost and Filter Lifespan

ZeroWater filters may need more frequent replacement, roughly every two months or after filtering 20 gallons, due to their thoroughness, resulting in higher long-term costs. Brita filters have a longer lifespan, changing approximately every four months or 120 gallons, making them more cost-effective over time.

If removing a broad spectrum of contaminants and ensuring the purest water possible is paramount, [ZeroWater](/dir/zerowater) is an excellent choice. Conversely, if you seek cost-effectiveness and speed in treating primarily taste and odor issues, Brita provides a reliable solution. By weighing these factors and considering your specific needs, you can select the pitcher filter that best meets your home's requirements.
