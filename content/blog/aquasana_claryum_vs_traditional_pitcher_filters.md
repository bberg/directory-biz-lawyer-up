# Aquasana's Claryum® Technology vs. Traditional Pitcher Filters

In the quest for providing cleaner and safer drinking water at home, consumers often find themselves at a crossroads between opting for advanced filtration technology like Aquasana’s Claryum® and more traditional pitcher filters. While both methods aim to reduce contaminants, the differences between them can influence a buyer's decision based on their needs and priorities.

## Key Considerations

Water filtration systems are not one-size-fits-all. When choosing between Aquasana’s Claryum® technology and traditional pitcher filters, consider the following key factors:

1. **Contaminant Reduction:** Aquasana's Claryum® technology is designed to reduce up to 78 contaminants, which is significantly higher compared to the standard gravity pitcher filters. This includes heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and other volatile organic compounds. On the other hand, traditional pitcher filters primarily focus on improving taste and odor, occasionally reducing a small number of contaminants such as chlorine and some heavy metals.

2. **Filter Lifespan and Cost:** Traditional pitcher filters tend to have a shorter lifespan, often requiring replacements every two to three months, potentially leading to a higher long-term cost. Aquasana’s Claryum® filters might have a higher upfront cost, but they last longer and remove more contaminants, which can be more cost-effective over time.

3. **Mineral Retention:** Aquasana’s Claryum® is noted for retaining beneficial minerals like calcium and magnesium, which contributes to better-tasting water and offers health benefits. Pitcher filters may not have the same capability, sometimes leading to demineralized water that may not taste as good or offer the same health benefits.

4. **Ease of Use:** Pitcher filters are known for their simplicity and portability. They require little to no installation and can be used by anyone. Aquasana systems, while slightly more complex to install, offer convenience through their under-sink and countertop solutions, providing filtered water on demand.

5. **Environmental Considerations:** With the increasing focus on sustainability, it’s important to note the environmental impact. Pitcher filters contribute to plastic waste due to frequent cartridge replacements. In contrast, Aquasana’s systems use durable components that require less frequent replacements, thereby reducing waste.
