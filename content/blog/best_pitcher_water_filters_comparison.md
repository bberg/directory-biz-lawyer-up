# The Best Pitcher Water Filters: A Comparison of Popular Brands

When it comes to ensuring you have access to clean, great-tasting water, opting for a pitcher water filter is a convenient and cost-effective solution. Unlike under-sink and faucet-mounted filters, water filter pitchers don't require installation. They are simply filled with tap water, which they purify through filtration media. Here's a look at some of the top brands on the market, their unique features, and what customers are saying.

## Key Considerations

Before purchasing a water filter pitcher, it's essential to consider factors such as the types of contaminants you want to remove, the capacity of the pitcher, the time it takes to filter water, and the cost of replacement filters. Additionally, the design of the pitcher—such as handle ergonomics and ease of refilling—might influence your decision.
